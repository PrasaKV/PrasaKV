## 🗺️ The World Map (Active Adventures)

*Instead of a list of tasks, here is where my banner currently flies:*

* **🏰 The Great Emporium:** I am currently enchanting a "Master Ledger" for a merchant’s guild, allowing them to track their silks and treasures with lightning speed across a magical looking-glass.
* **🛠️ The Architect’s Forge:** I am building a grand archive (a "Portfolio") to display the relics and artifacts I have recovered from past expeditions into the deep-cloud.
* **🌀 The Endless Library:** Every night, I study the "Ancient Runes of Efficiency," learning how to make my spells cast faster and use less mana (energy).

## 🎒 The Hero’s Inventory (My Arsenal)

*A knight is only as strong as his tools and his training.*

### 🔮 The High Runes
**Go & Rust:** My heaviest broadswords. Used for slaying dragons and building bridges that never collapse, no matter how many travelers cross them.

### 📜 The Universal Script
**Python & JavaScript:** My versatile scrolls. Whether I need to talk to a bird or automate a drawbridge, these allow me to speak to any creature in the realm.

### 🛡️ The Great Bastion
**Linux & Docker:** My armor and my fortress. They ensure that wherever I go, I carry my own safe environment, protected from the unpredictable storms of the outside world.
